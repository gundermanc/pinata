Pinata Android Application
(C) 2015 Christian Gunderman

INTRO:
 This is the Pinata android application source directory. It contains all
 Android specific code. Anything that is useful both client and server side
 goes in the shared directory instead.

LAYOUT:
 Standard Android application framework. The libs directory
 is where all third party files that can't be found in maven go.

SETUP:
 - Install Android SDK        - http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=tools
 - Configure Project          - <path_to_sdk>/tools/android update project -p <pinata_dir>

BUILD:
 At the moment, the build system is a bit messy because the Android Gradle
 plugin is too unstable for us to use, so we are using a hacky Gradle script
 instead.

 At compile-time, gradle imports all of the standard Android build tasks from
 the build.xml Ant file. It then renames these tasks to mirror the tasks of the
 service and shared projects so that they will all build together.

 Some things are still borked though: Gradle won't allow shared as a build
 prereq, so, you have to manually build the shared library each time you
 change it, or else it goes stale.
 
 Also, you should REALLY avoid using the Ant file. It theoretically works, but
 Gradle adds dependency management and other neccessary stuff.

 - Build Shared library       -
 - Switch to Pinata root      - cd ..
 - Switch to shared project   - cd shared
 - Build shared project       - gradle build
 - Switch to Pinata root      - cd ..
 - Switch to android project  - cd android
 - Build android project      - gradle build

DEPLOY:
 - Deploy to attached device  - gradle installd
                          OR  - ant install
