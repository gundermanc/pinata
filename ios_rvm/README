Pinata iOS RoboVM Application
(C) 2015 Christian Gunderman

INTRO:
 This is the RoboVM code for the iOS application. At the time of this writing
 our team was too small to write for BOTH iOS and Android so we compromised by
 using RoboVM to write the iOS UI, allowing us to develop the app in Java and
 share code between the Android side and the iOS side so we aren't wasting time
 rewriting the networking stack.

SETUP:
 - Obtain Mac OS X Monstrosity (There is a rant waiting to be unleashed here).
 - Install newest X Code. Probably 6 or greater.
 - Install Gradle.
  - Easiest method is to install homebrew package manager for OS X and run:
    brew install gradle

BUILD:
 - Build Java Code         - gradle ios_rvm:build  (does not build on non-Macs).

DEPLOY:
 - Deploy to iOS Simulator - gradle launchIPhoneSimulator
