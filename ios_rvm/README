Pinata iOS RoboVM Application
(C) 2015 Christian Gunderman

INTRO:
 This is the RoboVM code for the iOS application. At the time of this writing
 our team was too small to write for BOTH iOS and Android so we compromised by
 using RoboVM to write the iOS UI, allowing us to develop the app in Java and
 share code between the Android side and the iOS side so we aren't wasting time
 rewriting the networking stack.

SETUP:
 You MIGHT be able to COMPILE the Java code for the app on non-Mac computers
 since it IS just java, however will WILL need OS X and X Code to actually run
 it in the simulator.

 - Obtain Mac OS X Monstrosity (There is a rant waiting to be unleashed here).
 - Install newest X Code. Probably 6 or greater.
 - Install Gradle.
  - Easiest method is to install homebrew package manager for OS X and run:
    brew install gradle

BUILD:
 - Build Java Code         - gradle build  (might work on non-Macs).

DEPLOY:
 - Deploy to iOS Simulator - gradle launchIPhoneSimulator
